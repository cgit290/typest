      medium: "The sky was blue, and the sun was shining brightly, making everything feel warm and peaceful. I decided to take a walk to the store, so I called my friend to join me. We met outside my house and began walking down the street, talking about all kinds of things. We talked about school, the new movie we wanted to see, and how we both loved ice cream. As we walked, we passed by houses, trees, and gardens, noticing the small details around us like the birds chirping and the flowers blooming. When we finally reached the store, we spent a while picking out some snacks and drinks, deciding on chips, soda, and chocolate bars. After buying everything, we found a bench outside and sat down, enjoying our treats while people walked past. We noticed a few kids playing in the park across the street, and we talked about how we used to play there when we were younger.After finishing our snacks, we decided to head over to the park ourselves and joined in the game of soccer with some other kids. The ball was kicked back and forth, and we ran around laughing, trying to score goals. We didn’t keep score, but the fun of the game was enough. As we played, the sun began to lower in the sky, casting long shadows and turning everything a warm orange color. We took a break for a moment to catch our breath, sitting on the grass and talking about how nice it was to spend time outside. Eventually, we decided it was time to head home, so we walked slowly, enjoying the cool breeze that came as the sun set. On our way back, we talked about the next time we could hang out and what we’d do next. The day had been simple, but it felt perfect, and I was glad to have spent it with my friend.",
      hard: "One summer afternoon, I decided to visit my cousin’s house. The sun was shining brightly, and the sky was clear—perfect weather for a walk! I hadn’t seen her in a few months, and I was excited. When I arrived at her house, she greeted me at the door with a big hug. “It’s been too long!” she said, smiling. We sat down in the living room, and she immediately asked, “So, what’s new with you? How’s work, how’s life?” I smiled and began to tell her about my new job, but before I could finish, she interrupted, “Wait, did you hear about the new café that opened down the street?” I nodded eagerly. “Yes, I did! I’ve been wanting to check it out.” We decided to head over there together. It was a short walk—only about ten minutes—but it felt refreshing. The café was small but cozy, with soft music playing in the background. “Let’s grab some iced coffee,” she suggested. “You know, we can sit outside and talk about everything!” I agreed. We sat down, ordered our drinks, and continued chatting. The conversation shifted from work to travel—plans, dreams, and places we wanted to visit. “Have you been to Italy yet?” she asked. I shook my head. “Not yet, but it’s on my list!” After about an hour of talking, we decided to walk around the block to stretch our legs. We passed by the park, where kids were playing soccer, and a couple was having a picnic under a large tree. “I love days like this,” I said. “The weather’s perfect, the air’s fresh... everything’s just right.” She agreed, nodding. “Yeah, sometimes, the little things matter the most.”We walked around a bit more, laughing and enjoying the moment. It was a simple, peaceful day, and as we headed back to her house, I couldn’t help but think: What a great way to spend an afternoon! By the time I left, the sky was starting to turn orange with the setting sun. It had been one of those perfect days you never forget."
